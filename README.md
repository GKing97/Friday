Interests:

-Animation/Movies. My major is actually in Film and I'm trying to concentrate in animation. I like to draw via digital tablet. Currently experimenting 3d with Maya.

-Sound Design/Music Production. Grew up listening to a lot of EDM (still do)and wanted to make weird computer noises myself via software synths and audio editing. This also applies for film/game sound design.

-Video Games. A culmination of the first two interests but interactive. Some of my favorite games for the music are Ape Escape 3, Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2, Sonic Mania, Nier Automata, Legend of Zelda OoT, and Undertale

It's always hard to recommend memes, as humor is subjective and shelf life for most memes are so short nowadays, but here's one I recall a while back: https://preview.redd.it/dv34i6v0g2n41.gif?format=mp4&s=e8e3005ab1451c85b165b985532157bf53deb8b5
